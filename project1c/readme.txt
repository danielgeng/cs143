Project 1C: Create a Movie Database website (i.e. IMDB)

Testing

Added some pauses to the Selenium test cases because things were taking a while to load (especially actor/director/movie lists).

There should not be any problems on either Fastest or Slowest settings.

t2 - There is no gender attribute on the Director schema
t4 - No user specified for test case, so I just used 'user' and 'user2'
